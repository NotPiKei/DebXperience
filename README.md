# DebXperience
A small project of a custom Debian distribution/iso.

Hello,
I created a custom Debian iso with a purpose of having a different installation than the default debian installation with gnome. The gnome desktop that is installed is customized and the software that is included is different. It's not really a different distribution but I still wanted to give it a custom name.

Here is an example of how it looks like:

The tools I used to create it are:
- Remastersys: https://github.com/Nerun/remastersys,
- Calamares: https://github.com/calamares/calamares,
- calamares-settings-debian: https://github.com/CatalystDevOrg/calamares-settings-debian

The software that is included are:
-Chromium 
-Notepadqq 
-Alacritty 
-Abiword 
-Gthumb 
-Gparted 
-Qalculate! 
-Htop 
-VLC 
However I have still left some applications that come with gnome and debian, such as firefox and other gnome tools. The applications that I have added are different to compliment my workflow, and they tend to be more feature packed than the ones you get with gnome.

The extensions I added to gnome are:
- ArcMenu
- BlurMyShell
- DashToPanel.

The look is mostly there to replicate the windows or kde taskbar.

Future additions:
- Flatpak installed
- Some kind of theme
- A second desktop environment
  

I don't really know what else to include in this repository or this readme. Any assistance is appreciated.
